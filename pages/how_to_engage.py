    ### ROI Calculation Methodology
    
    This projection is based on:
    
    1. **Initial Investment**: The resources required to implement the strategy, including personnel, platform costs, and media spend
    
    2. **Ongoing Investment**: Continued resource allocation to maintain and optimize the strategy
    
    3. **Returns**: Projected revenue from new customers, increased retention, higher purchase frequency, or other relevant metrics
    
    4. **ROI Calculation**: (Cumulative Returns / Cumulative Investment - 1) Ã— 100
    
    ### Key Assumptions
    
    - The strategy is implemented as outlined in the action plan
    - Market conditions remain relatively stable
    - Competitors do not make significant unexpected moves
    - The belief patterns identified remain consistent
    
    ### Risk Factors
    
    - Implementation delays could shift the ROI curve to the right
    - Higher than anticipated competition could reduce returns
    - Economic changes could impact consumer spending patterns
